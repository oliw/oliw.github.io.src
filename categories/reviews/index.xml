D. Vance is a memoir of a boy growing up in Ohio in a [sic] white working class family that had its fair share of hardship and troubles with addiction. Its written very straightforwardly and conjures a vivid picture of the author&amp;rsquo;s upbringing. I read this book because it was being billed online as a good insight into a part of America that had been out of sight and out of mind.</description></item></channel></rss>
