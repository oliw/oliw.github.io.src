Services tend to talk to other services. These services might be owned by you, another team at work, or made available by a third party (e.g. Google Maps API).
How tolerant is your service to the failure of one of these upstream services?</description></item><item><title>Hillbilly Eligy</title><link>https://oliverwilkie.com/2017/01/hillbilly/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2017 16:44:36 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://oliverwilkie.com/2017/01/hillbilly/</guid><description>The Hillbilly Eligy by J. D. Vance is a memoir of a boy growing up in Ohio in a [sic] white working class family that had its fair share of hardship and troubles with addiction. Its written very straightforwardly and conjures a vivid picture of the author&amp;rsquo;s upbringing. I read this book because it was being billed online as a good insight into a part of America that had been out of sight and out of mind.</description></item><item><title>Ornaments</title><link>https://oliverwilkie.com/2016/12/ornaments/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2016 15:10:35 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://oliverwilkie.com/2016/12/ornaments/</guid><description>The morning of my flight home for the holidays I hastily came up with something for my family&amp;rsquo;s arts&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;crafts gift exchange.
Luckily the Techshop was pretty quiet so I could get some time on the Laser Cutter to draw up these fellas
It took three iterations to get it right, the first was too big, the second was good but needed handles. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve got it though, its just a question of copy and paste to make lots!</description></item><item><title>Danish Christmas Tree</title><link>https://oliverwilkie.com/2016/12/danish-christmas-tree/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2016 14:28:56 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://oliverwilkie.com/2016/12/danish-christmas-tree/</guid><description> Late November I made this Wooden Dowel Christmas Tree with advent-style felt ornaments (with some talented friends helping with all the ornaments).
The tree is collapsible (you just pull the branches out) which is useful for the rest of the year when its not Christmas!
Lessons learned Dowel is cheap 25 hand-stiched ornaments can take a while Once you&amp;rsquo;re half way through you have to finish!

For my team&amp;rsquo;s monthly drink&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;sync I wrote an interactive worksheet on using TensorFlow to build a handwritten number detector.

The experience made me truely appreciate just how effective Heroku is and how it has made deploying apps as painfree as could be. After all, what good is making an app if nobody can see it!
I&amp;rsquo;ve also been a huge fan of my Raspberry Pi. Every time I look at it, I feel challenged to think of a cool use for it.</description></item></channel></rss>
