D. Vance is a memoir of a boy growing up in Ohio in a [sic] white working class family that had its fair share of hardship and troubles with addiction. Its written very straightforwardly and conjures a vivid picture of the author&rsquo;s upbringing. I read this book because it was being billed online as a good insight into a part of America that had been out of sight and out of mind. I don&rsquo;t think this wholly explains why the &lsquo;16 election swung the way it did but nevertheless a worthwhile read.</p><p>Tidbits I took away from this book were:</p><ul><li>Be wary of the perils of living in an area that has one large main employer.</li><li>If an area suddenly has no jobs, the bottom of the housing market can fall out and only the relatively rich can afford to bite the cost and move away.</li><li>The author notes that the most stable/happy members of his family were those that married other halves from happier/stabler backgrounds.</li><li>Adverse childhood experiences can rear their ugly head in adulthood.</li><li>Addiction is the worst.</li><li>Its very hard to resist a community&rsquo;s weariness and resignation about class immobility.</li></ul></div><p>Want to talk about this post?
