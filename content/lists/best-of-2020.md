A list of things I consumed and enjoyed in 2020 (even if they came out long before then!)

The rule was they had to come freely, if I had to remind myself what I had read/seen/watched/done then it wasn’t good enough to feature in this list.

## Best Books

- Overstory - Trees, People and Prose
- Giovannis Room - The secret worlds shared by two people
- Exit West - A refugee fairy tale
- Extreme Ownership - Motivates you to do a great job
- Bullshit Jobs - Reminds you about bullshit jobs!

## Best Online Reads

- [Domestic Jungle Is Where The Heart Is](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/ask-kim-kierkegaardashian-domestic-jungle-is-where-the-heart-is) was no question the best thing I read all year. Even though its satire, it nails how I feel about modern life and modern society.

## Best Movies

- Force Majeure - A man abandons his family to try and save himself and pretends it didn't happen.
- My Dinner with Andre - Two men eat dinner and talk about the different directions their life took.
- I’m thinking of ending things

Runner up: Burning, Under the Skin
