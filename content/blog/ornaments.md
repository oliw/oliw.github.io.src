The morning of my flight home for the holidays I hastily came up with something for my family's arts'n'crafts gift exchange.

Luckily the Techshop was pretty quiet so I could get some time on the Laser Cutter to draw up these fellas

It took three iterations to get it right, the first was too big, the second was good but needed handles. Once you've got it though, its just a question of copy and paste to make lots!
