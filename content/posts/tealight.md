{{< figure src="/tealight.jpg" title="Walnut Tealight Holder">}}

Still horrendous at making things with my hands but will keep trying! This is a tealight holder that is basically three bits of wood, two drill holes and glue.

- Band Saw
- Pillar Drilling Machine
- 1 1/2" Forstner Bit
- Sand Paper
- Wood Glue
- Circular Saw

### Lessons learnt

#### Buying Wood

- Walnut is a beautiful dark hardwood
- Walnut is expensive
- A DIY Store will sell wood at fixed lengths, but will cut it into pieces for you.
- My car can fit about 10feet of wood just!

#### Prepping

- Make a detailed plan beforehand.
- If it doesn't work on paper it won't work in the shop (this applies to coding too btw). Draw out everything to scale.
- Use SketchUp or some other CAD software if you want to have reusable plans.
- Itemize the equipment you'll need. Nothing more frustrating than being halfway through and realising you don't have any sanding paper!
- Use Painters Tape or Super77 glue to stick your paper plans onto real wood.

#### In the Shop

- Sanding concave curves is hard without a spindle sander
- Always sand with the grain
- Wood Glue needs clamps and needs to sit clamped for at least 30mins
- Have a Pencil and a backup!
