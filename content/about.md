Hi, I'm [Oli](https://twitter.com/oliwilks) and I [work as a software engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owilkie/) in San Francisco.

I spend a lot of time writing ruby code for [Flexport](http://flexport.com/) to automate and scale tasks such as boat tracking, boat timetables and cost prediction. Before that I spent several years down the road at [Square](https://squareup.com/) working on logistics problems. My primary focus wherever I go is getting stuff done by writing software efficiently and applying it wisely to areas that havenâ€™t fully benefited from it so far.

I'm a believer in technology, but also [digital minimalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism), and am passionate about finding that [balance between the two](https://www.humanetech.com/).

I owe my footing in this world to loving parents, supportive teachers, a [Randy Pausch lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo) and the earnestness of youth which took me to London to study [Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) at Imperial College, then [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibes) to intern (and have the summer of a lifetime) and then a pilgrimage to San Francisco which I've happily called home for the past six years.
