I'm a Software Engineer @ Square, currently working on the suite of projects that power the Logistics for Caviar. I have competency in a variety of languages and frameworks with a particular focus on Java, Ruby, Python and Javascipt.

Besides engineering, I spend as much time as I can hiking and backpacking through California. I also enjoy running, music, reading fiction and independant cinema.

I have a first-class Engineering Masters degree in Computing from Imperial College London. My final year project concerning Motion Stabilisation methods for Robotically Assisted Heart Surgery was awarded the Distinguished Project status. Outside of the department, I enjoyed serving as Technical Manager for ICRadio.

I strive to be affable, and endeavour to be forever self-improving.
