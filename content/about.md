[I design and build software](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owilkie/) for myself and for emerging technology companies, mainly in San Francisco.

At [Flexport](http://flexport.com/) I have automated and scaled tasks such as boat tracking, boat timetables and cost prediction.

At [Square](https://squareup.com/) I have led the logistics and operations engineering teams responsible for Square's restaurant delivery product.

At [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) I studied Computing, Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

I also make small, cheap and useful indie apps like [ThatThatThis](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thatthatthis-decision-maker/id1529817354).

My focus is getting stuff done by writing software efficiently and applying it wisely to areas that I believe havenâ€™t fully benefited from it so far. I'm a believer in technology, but also [digital minimalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism), and am interested in the [balance between the two](https://www.humanetech.com/).

I'm British. I've lived in the UK, France and currently live in the Bay Area. I'm a trail runner and a backpacker. One of my favorite annual adventures is finding and staying in remote old fire lookout towers.
