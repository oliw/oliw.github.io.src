Oliver Wilkie is a software engineer in San Francisco.

Oli spends a lot of time writing ruby code at Flexport to automate and scale tasks such as boat tracking, boat timetables and cost prediction. Before that Oli spent several years down the road at Square working on logistics problems of a different kind. Oli’s primary focus wherever he goes is getting stuff done by writing software efficiently and applying it wisely to areas that haven’t fully benefited from it so far. A believer in technology, but also digital minimalism, Oli is passionate about finding that balance between the two.

Oil owes his start to loving parents, supportive teachers, a [Randy Pausch lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo) and the earnestness of youth which carried him to London to study Computing at Imperial College, then France to intern (and frankly have the summer of a lifetime) and finally a pilgrimage to San Francisco which he now calls home.
